server takover - Server Takeover is a feature that allows players who are matchmaking and choosing to start their own private game to "grab" a server that has not opted out for them to use during their play time. This will change the settings on the server to those that the players want and make it private. However it will not expose any of the private information about that server (such as admin passwords) to them. At the end of their stay in the server, the server will open back up again and await new players or another takeover request.
